This is the analysis of airplanes crashes in the history.

You can find here some interesting charts and information about them. The graphs' comments are written in Italian but all the code is English, so you can easily understand it.

All the analysis are written in Python and charts are made with Plotly.

In this notebook, you'll find also the source and the link to all datasets we used to do this job.
